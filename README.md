# rubberduck - V.5 May 28, 2021

We're going to make a web app that re-creates the [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) experience.

Here's the [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/V01n0TKenJSTtXLmQXE8dU/Rubber-Duck-Debugging?node-id=5%3A90) of what we're aiming for [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).

~~Here's our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/b4Mqzw98/mern-rubber-duck-debug)~~. We're using [Github's Project tab](https://github.com/freecodecampBarrie/rubberduck/projects/2).

We also have a [Github Team](https://github.com/orgs/freecodecampBarrie/teams/rubber_duckies/members) for approving PRs and Merges, also ask during Zoom call to become a member by giving us your Github userid.

We'll also be referencing this [tutorial](https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/creating-mern-stack-applications-2020-4a44) to setup the MERN stack. [Paul](https://github.com/paulywill) is hacking on a boilerplate [demo](https://github.com/paulywill/anime-tracker).

Goals within [2](https://www.google.com/search?q=countdown+for+2+hours) _**OR**_ [3](https://www.google.com/search?q=countdown+for+3+hours) hour meetup:
- [x] Discuss workflow with group
- [x] Setup ideal environment
- [ ] working MERN stack
- [ ] React frontend that tackles close to [wireframe/prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/V01n0TKenJSTtXLmQXE8dU/Rubber-Duck-Debugging?node-id=5%3A90)
- [ ] Host working MVP on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com
)/[Netify](https://www.netlify.com/
)/whereever
- [ ] Add some CI/CD for fun?
- [ ] Redirect with newly purchased Google domain [quackback.dev](quackback.dev)
- [ ] Find out how effective Zoom + hackathon can really be [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) vs. [Repl.it](repl.it) vs. [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io)
