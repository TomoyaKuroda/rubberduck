# rubberduck

We're going to make a web app that re-creates the [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) experience.

Here's the [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/V01n0TKenJSTtXLmQXE8dU/Rubber-Duck-Debugging?node-id=5%3A90) of what we're aiming for [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).

We'll also be referencing this [tutorial](https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/creating-mern-stack-applications-2020-4a44) to setup the MERN stack. [Paul](https://github.com/paulywill) is hacking on the resulting [demo](https://github.com/paulywill/anime-tracker).

Goals within 2 hour meetup:
- [ ] working MERN stack
- [ ] React frontend that tackles close to wireframe/prototype
- [ ] Host working MVP on Heroku/Netify/whereever
- [ ] Redirect with newly purchased domain [quackback.dev](quackback.dev)
- [ ] Find out how effective Zoom + hackathon can really be (VS Code vs. Repl.it vs. Codesandbox)
