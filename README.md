# rubberduck - V.5 May 28, 2021

We're going to make a web app that re-creates the [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) experience.

Here's the [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/V01n0TKenJSTtXLmQXE8dU/Rubber-Duck-Debugging?node-id=5%3A90) of what we're aiming for [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).

We'll also be referencing this [tutorial](https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/creating-mern-stack-applications-2020-4a44) to setup the MERN stack. [Paul](https://github.com/paulywill) is hacking on a boilerplate [demo](https://github.com/paulywill/anime-tracker).

Goals within 2-3 hour meetup:
- [ ] Discuss workflow with group
- [ ] Setup ideal environment / Trello / IDE / Sharing Etc.
- [ ] working MERN stack
- [ ] React frontend that tackles close to [wireframe/prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/V01n0TKenJSTtXLmQXE8dU/Rubber-Duck-Debugging?node-id=5%3A90)
- [ ] Host working MVP on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com
)/[Netify](https://www.netlify.com/
)/whereever
- [ ] Redirect with newly purchased Google domain [quackback.dev](quackback.dev)
- [ ] Find out how effective Zoom + hackathon can really be [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) vs. [Repl.it](repl.it) vs. [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io)
